EccDNA Graph Solver Module

This module implements graph-based cycle detection for identifying extrachromosomal 
circular DNA (ecDNA) structures from validated junction breakpoints and discordant 
read pairs. It uses sparse matrix representations for efficient computation and 
strongly connected components (SCC) algorithm for cycle detection.

Key Features:
- Constructs directed graphs from breakpoint junctions
- Supports both single-segment circles (self-loops) and multi-segment circles (cycles)
- Uses scipy.sparse for memory-efficient adjacency matrix representation
- Implements confidence scoring based on posterior probabilities

Author: CircleDetect Team
Based on: Circle-Map methodology

    Graph-based solver for detecting ecDNA circular structures.
    
    This class constructs a directed graph where:

    - Directed edges between nodes represent multi-segment connections (supported by discordant reads)
    
    Cycle detection is performed using strongly connected components (SCC) algorithm,
    where each SCC represents a potential ecDNA circle.
